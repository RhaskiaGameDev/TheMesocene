Community can help change the game by supporting us and submitting ideas, skins, and even their own animals to the devs!

A light amount of gore is in the game, there will be no organs hanging out, but there will be blood and bones, so be wary when you play this game!

Vehicles will be obtainable within the game, but be careful, they cause lots of noise!

Release date: NONE KNOWN AS OF NOW.

Recently Extinct animals will also be included.

Dossiers will be part of the game as to learn about the animals on the go without finding special stands to inform you about the animals. (We’ll talk more about the stands later!)

Genetic engineering will allow you to choose different colors and patterns for your animals! Maybe even new creatures or ones with special traits!

3 Companies, 3 Feuds.

K.R.Y.O. creates semi-accurate assets and dabbles in temporal anomalies.

C.S.O. creates Nightmare fuel and Cybernetics.

P.A.R.A. (Prehistoric Animal Recreation Association) specializes in Accurate assets and caretaking of said animals.

Creature Customization? Yes please!

Each creature will get 3-4 Color Schemes! (Still deciding this or color changes)

Along with additional cosmetics to use!

There is weaponry! If you don’t like that, then why are you playing a survival-esque game?
